"#finalverdicthousefull 4 is that rare genre of films which will test your patience with its foolishness, shock you with its lack of logic &amp; launch a vicious assault on your senses. utter nonsense!usually, a paragraph is devoted in reviews to detail the plot &amp; screenplay but to say that housefull 4 has even a semblance of the two is a poor joke. the audience is just going to shake their head in dismay &amp; frustration as the intolerable cruelty unfolds.fridays are becoming a messy hodgepodge in bollywood with each transient months, in the matter of getting an epochal release and a diwali release is an event in itself. but the makers of housefull 4 have literally shown a middle finger to the audiences. sure, we relish madcap entertainers, but what director farhad samji serves in housefull 4 transcends all limits. he attempts a crazy, simple entertainer yet again, but peppers it with inane, ridiculous episodes that makes you wonder, is this for real? sara bodinar and sajid nadiadwala's story drains you at the end, despite the actors putting their best foot forward to make you giggle. the banal jokes &amp; the lame pjs coupled with the muddled screenplay are clearly responsible for the epic mess.the soundtrack of housefull 4 is pleasant, with the composer (sohail sen) belting out a couple of hummable tunes. the plush locales of london &amp; the grandiose production design ( subrata chakraborty-amit ray) gives the film the required scale. and that's it.vfx should've been better. editing (rameshwar s bhagat) is uneven. this singularly unfunny film plumbs the depths of comedic bankruptcy by a director who quite frankly, hasn't delivered anything funny in a long time.akshay kumar plays to the gallery but is letdown by the writing. also, he tries too hard to be funny. riteish deshmukh hams to the hilt. bobby deol looks out of place completely. the leading ladies - kriti sanon, pooja hegd and kriti kharbanda - are pure eye candies. chunky panday is wasted. ditto for ranjeet, johny lever, sharad kelkar, rana daggubati and nawazuddin siddiqui.on the whole, it'll be difficult for housefull 4 to sustain once the initial euphoria settles down. it's all bad. all of it, every last instant, every single word. simply put, housefull 4 is an unforgivable farce. this is public harassment - a precise sentence i'll use to describe the experience. if you thought comedy could sink no further. watch just 15 minutes of housefull 4 and you'd be disavowed of that notion.",1

best known world-wide for its bollywood musicals, hindi cinema has an unusual example with good newwz, a smart comedy about two very different couples with the last name and mixed-up sperm for an in-vitro operation. not only are there too-few musical numbers spectacles of brilliant color and rousing song and dance, but also important thematic issues for contemporary couples recur.varun (ashay kumar) and deepti (kareena kapoor) are the smart couple who argue about the difficulty of successfully conceiving and the issues like his labor in the process and her pressuring him to perform, much less care enough. the other couple, honey (diljit dosanjh) and monika) (kiara advani), are happy go lucky, and while less intellectually capable, they are emotionally better able to deal with the mix-up.the center of this dramatic stew is the indian obsession with having children, including the superiority of bloodline over adoption. allied is an unspoken matter of having a female child rather than a male, a topic thankfully never addressed. in between are challenges of men understanding women's many issues related to the important nine months and the need for cherishing babies and parents regardless of their place in the tangled world of affections and parentage.director raj mehta twirls the camera in such different locations as hospital and dance halls while keeping it an intimate affair with couples overly wrought about having babies. not much zen but a whole lot of love. hooray bollywood, you're challenging the american musical legend of matching song with sentiment.""i would love to work in a bollywood film as there is so much drama and colour in the films there."" brad pitt",-1

"good newwz review :-from the trailer we all got the idea of what is the basic story of good newwz starring akshay kumar, kareena kapoor khan, diljit dosanjh and kiara advani, right? what it offers more in the film is funny storytelling and emotional quotient with some valid reasons. a sensitive topic like this (ivf) is being told in funny manners wasn't looking appropriate when the trailer came out and there was a constant fear that this goof up might get messed up because of comedy touch but thankfully everything here is perfect whether it is comedy, presentation or content. we haven't seen much goof up stories in bollywood and good newwz is probably the best among those rare films.varun batra (akshay kumar) and deepu batra (kareena kapoor) an urban couple give nod to ivf process to have a baby but accidentally there is another couple of same surname who is also trying the same process to have a baby. the technician in lab gets confused between two batra's and mix up thier samples. now this is something really interesting and it creates lot of funny confusions, intentional face offs and quirky flights. but at the end there is much needed emotional touch to end the film on happy note and you also get to know that why there are two 'w's in the film's title.akshay kumar as varun batra is truly hilarious. he will make you laugh out loudly with his dialogues and expressions. kareena kapoor as his high class wife is bindass, she's bossing type and looks convincing urban housewife. diljit dosanjh joins the party late but he is freaking funny from the first scene and end up having so much fun. kiara advani plays a devotional, sober housewife and she looks cute. adil hussain and tisca chopra play a perfect doctor couple who have successfully delivered 26,000+ babies in thier hospital and assure a good news through a video advertise. anjana sukhani is seen after a long time on screen and she plays akshay kumar's sister, a lawyer by profession with enough conviction.written by jyoti kapoor and raj mehta good newwz is a perfect tale of comedy, important subject and emotions. finally, bollywood gets that one perfect urban comedy for multiplex audience. dialogues by rishab sharma are quirky and also create meaningful situational comedy continuosly. music is fantastic because all songs appear on perfect situations and that's why doesn't look boring. 'sauda khara' doesn't have a separate video and still it is the best among all despite having only background playing mode.raj mehta debuts with a strong film and he will surely recieve lots of praise for his directorial skills in this film. telling this sensitive topic with comedy touch was a risk but he dared to do so and successfully achieved the destination. the comedy seems quite high class sometimes but fortunately it didn't cross the limits. good newwz is a perfect mixture of goof, urban comedy, emotions and all cinematic properties. good newwz ends 2019 with the bang and there are no second thoughts about it's commercial success. go and have a good time with good newwz.rating- 7/10*",-1

"good newwz review :badaltey sperms ka terror!! whats this unique comedy of error..generating lol through interchange of twins or doppelgangers has been subject matter for many bollywood hits in the past. with good newwz, this adla-badli genre (if it can be called that!) goes two steps further with sperms getting interchanged during an ivf (in-vitro fertilization) procedure and causing havoc for the two batra couples.varun (akshay kumar) and deepti batra (kareena kapoor) are the hi-fi mumbaiites at one end of this sperm swap while honey (diljit dosanjh) and monika batra (kiara advani), a boisterously loud chandigarh couple, are the other affected party due to their fertility expert's (adil hussain) negligence. as both deepti and moni get pregnant, honey decides to shift lock, stock and barrel as varun's neighbour so as to keep an eye on deepti bearing his biological child.right from the hilarious opening banter between akshay and kareena, good newwz keeps you thoroughly entertained throughout its two hour fifteen minutes of run time. particularly, the first half is sure to bring the house down with its non stop gags and solid punch lines. the second half gets tad serious which ofcourse, is essential for the plot. note the superbly executed kareena's monologue to akshay on problem every mother faces to give birth to a child. truly heartfelt that!more on the positive, akshay kumar is in top form with his perfect comic timing. kareena kapoor looks absolutely gorgeous and reaffirms her acting mettle in the aforementioned monologue scene. diljit dosanjh, a brilliant actor that he is, keeps us invested in a character which is so loud and over the top. kiara advani is sincere. so are adil hussain and tisca chopra as the gynaecs.on the tech front, vishnu rao's cinematography is top notch. trust me, mumbai has never looked so beautiful. the songs are mostly well known punjabi remixes and the end credit one is the only original number as producer karan johar announces in his special appearance.debutant director raj mehta and writer jyoti kapoor deserve applause for giving a nice comic touch to such a sensitive topic and making good newzz a light breezy entertainer to be enjoyed with family and friends.an ideal holiday movie indeed!regards

"tackling a fresh and complex subject in a simplified manner isn't an easy task. but it seems the makers have succeeded in that. filled with great writing, neat direction, brilliant performances ; this one is surely up for full on entertainment. those jokes, one liners will make you laugh hard as well as the emotional scenes will surely make you cry. the balance between these two contrary emotions are well maintained and they never felt carried away or exhaustive in nature. personally i would have liked to see more from the side characters and maybe a bit more screen presence for diljit and kiara's characters respectively! although this film did deliver the message well. i'm glad they found a right way to introduce such a newly adapted concept here in bollywood. with comedy and heartwarming elements ; they made it easier to connect with the audience on the same line. unlike most of the times when these kind of social awarenesses got forgotten due to the overly realistic approach from the directors or should i say more darker tonality in general writing of those subjects. but this mixture had hit the notes on point. overall a surprisingly great movie that everyone can enjoy and learn from.",-1

"the trailer of good newwz was enough for me to go watch this film. it gave off a great vibe of freshness and the cast involved looked like they were going to deliver (literally). also i had to find a way to calm myself down from the debacle that was dabangg 3 so this seemed like a good option.good newwz is about two couples, both surnames being batra, who go for a process known as in-vitro fertilisation in order to have a baby. however the process goes awry as they find out the sperms of both couples get mixed up leading to hilarious situations.from start to finish, this film is a laugh riot. there are some fantastic dialogues that is sure to bring laughter from you. this is due to the fantastic writing by rishabh sharma, jyoti kapoor and raj mehta. all three did a good job creating a script that feels unique and fun all the way. this is a film i feel i can watch more than once and not get bored of its jokes. it seriously is that funny.another standout is the performances of each actor. kareena kapoor gives a fantastic performance as deepti. she manages to ground this character and make us fully understand her constant want for a child. she expresses a great amount of emotion which helps her character feel believable at all times. kiara advani also delivers a great impression. whilst she may not have as much to do compared to the others, she plays off everyone well and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast. diljit dosanjh and akshay kumar provide the majority of comedy with their splendid performances. dosanjh's portrayal of the over the top and obnoxious honey is a delight to witness and kumar's frustrated varun makes a lot of moments in the film really memorable. the clinic scenes are also fuelled with laughter from the great acting by adil hussain and tisca chopra.what i didn't like about the film was the background score. i think the makers relied on establishing the tone of a scene and how to make the audience feel by the music rather what was taking place. if a sad scene was playing then sad music was playing and if a comedic scene was happening then there would be comedic sound effects or music. i think the film would have benefited more if the score wasn't so overpowering. i'm sure that the audience understands how to feel during a scene so it's better to do it visually rather than spoonfeeding us the emotion. i also feel that there were too many songs in the film which made it drag a bit. whilst the humour in the film was good, the emotional scenes could be improved. it felt a bit too dramatic which took away the full effect of the scene. finally, akshay kumar's character goes through an arc which did not feel developed enough to me.apart from the flaws, this film succeeds in what it wants to achieve. good newwz is definitely one of the funniest films of the year filled with terrific performances from the cast and a good debut from director raj mehta. i'll say this is a satisfying end to the year.",-1

"deepti (kareena kapoor khan) and varun batra (akshay kumar) are a posh, high-flying married couple, living in mumbai and are much involved with their respective careers. deepti also has her heart set on having a baby and after trying for a few years and then, some prodding by the family, both varun and she decide to consult one of the best fertility specialists in the city. the doctor advises ivf and they are ready for it. only hitch, few days after the procedure is through, deepti and varun are told there has been a sperm mix-up with another couple with the same last name. enter 'the batras from chandigarh' into their lives. honey (diljit dosanjh) and monika (kiara advani) are a loud punjabi couple and now it's a complete clash of sensibilities between the two sets of batras. as both deepti and monika soon find out they are pregnant, the rest of the film forms how the couples come to terms and deal with this unusual situation.
through much of its runtime, director raj mehta ensures that 'good newwz' stays true to its genre with several light-hearted and funny moments. add to that, the pace of the film stays mostly tight. although given the subject and premise the narrative, at times, treads into a problematic zone and stance. and some of the jokes seem off-colour. there's also a tendency to over explain and simplify in some portions which stick out. also, the screenplay barely scratches the surface when it comes to getting into the depth and complexity of the situation.
however, the performances are top-notch. kareena kapoor khan steals the show and delivers a knockout performance as the sophisticated deepti, and her character's emotional arc is developed well. akshay kumar hits the right spot with his comic timing. as does diljit dosanjh, who sinks his teeth into his character and plays it with full gusto. kiara advani is sincere and makes an impression. adil hussain as the straight-faced doctor, at the core of all the confusion, is a hoot. and as a couple, both kareena and akshay play off each other well and many of their interactions come off as very relatable.",-1
"good newwz - is ivf for dummies, almost practically, clearly, painstakingly and with the rationale behind its need. two batra couples (from mumbai and chandigarh respectively) coincidentally come to the same ivf clinic as traditional methods have failed to yield, and encounter a strange twist of fate as the semen samples are inadvertently switched. that is definitely an original story idea to bollywood and the precursor and aftermath are dealt with both funnily and emotionally in the two halves of the film by director raj mehta.the first half is rip roaring with akshay kumar going hammer and tongs with his comic timing. he and kareena kapoor khan play the urban and sophisticated varun and deepti batra, trying to come to terms with the fact that time is running out for natural conception. their interpersonal relationship and resultant communication are downright hilarious, even though kareena appears over the top at times. in contrast, diljeet dosanjh and kiara advani playing honey and monika batra are more rustic, unpolished and loud, but definitely more endearing. the second half tries to sort out the mess created by the switch, mostly dealing with emotional changes and coming to terms with the catastrophic reality when both women decide to keep the babies. matters obviously turn serious when varun's apathy and indifference change for the better with sense prevailing. the foursome is a treat to watch as they are very different people and are given equitable weightage to keep the viewer interest from waning.good newwz makes for an appealing watching for its freshness, diverse characters and performances, fantastic comic timing and high energy. more importantly, the mix of comedy and drama in balance doesn't allow impunity to the subject matter which remains the central theme. do watch the film for a feel good few hours, dollops of laughter and some social messages to end the year with.",1
